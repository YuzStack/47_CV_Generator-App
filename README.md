CV Generator is a professional utility application designed to help users create and preview their resumes in real time. This project was built to master the complexities of managing multiple input fields and synchronizing that data across a live preview interface.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend Library:** React.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## 🧠 The Independent Build Workflow

While I was progressing through my React curriculum, I took a detour to tackle a challenge from **The Odin Project.** I built this application 100% independently to test my ability to handle large scale state without a tutorial. This project was a significant milestone in my journey toward writing clean, predictable, and state-driven React code.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real Time Preview:** Implemented a side-by-side layout where users can see their CV update instantly as they type, providing immediate visual feedback.
- **Complex Form Management:** Successfully managed multiple state objects for personal information, educational background, and professional experience.
- **Dynamic Content Editing:** Built functionality that allows users to seamlessly switch between an "Edit" mode for data entry and a polished "Preview" mode for the final result.
- **Persistent Data Flow:** Ensured that data is correctly mapped from the input components to the structured CV template, maintaining data integrity throughout the app.
- **Clean & Professional UI:** Focused on a minimalist design that prioritizes readability and professional aesthetics, suitable for a real world resume tool.
